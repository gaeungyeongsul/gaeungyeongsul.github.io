```
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
For example, array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
is a permutation, but array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.
The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
the function should return 1.
Given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
the function should return 0.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

```Java
class Solution {
    public int solution(int[] A) {
        int odd = 0;
        int even = 0;
        int sum = A.length * (A.length + 1) / 2;
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
            sum -= A[i];
            if(A[i] % 2 ==1)
                odd++;
            else
                even++;
            if(A[i] > A.length)
                return 0;
        }
        if((odd == even || odd == (even + 1)) && sum == 0)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
```
